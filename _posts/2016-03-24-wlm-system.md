# WLM-System
![Water Distribution Network Leakage Management](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bb4301fd-1aab-4536-aa49-c33cc871187d.png)

WLM-System is a unique instrumentation/analytic system capable to perform hydraulic survey, flow and pressure profile analysis.  Also, the system is made for water loss monitoring by automatic leak zone generation creating a Virtual Zone, which enables sustainable reduction of loss water.  The system is an active support for strategic leak detection.

## Sensor

The methodology that WLM-System utilized is continuously simultaneous measurement of  FLOW, PRESSURE, NOISE and TEMPERATURE.  Typically this measurement is performed during the calm night hours where flows are at is minimum speed, i.e. between 3 and 4 am.  Measurement are obtained, processed and stored for later transmission to a central PC (or online).  Every deviation found between the measured and previously stored values such as increased flow, flow direction changes, decrease pressure and/or higher noise (leak or flow noise) is automatically registered and displayed with an alarm raised by software.  Assuming that all registered leakages are properly repaired, a permanent improvement in the water loss situation is achieved. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/948e63f3-334d-4581-be8a-2abd7496f6c5.jpg)

Feature:

* Strategic distribution of sensors with the aim to recognize conspicuities in each network sector.  Additionally, the system allows the development of network diagnostics. Measurement of very slow speed (v of 0.01 m/s) = Pipe network calculation. 
* Active leakage survey Installation to any pipe dimension/material 
* Hot tapping under full pressure 
* Long term maintenance free 
* Keeping leakage level at a minimum Analogue noise interface -- hydrophone (connection to correlator) 
* Diagnosis of network condition 
* "ONLINE" leakage warning 
* Step by step installation 
* Immediate leakage warning 
* Easy connection to any SCADA system 
* SMS-Warning 
* Highly cost effective chamber installation with Hawlinger 
* IP68 Protection up to 10 meters 
* GSM, GPRS, Ethernet, RS-232, 4-20mA 
* Optional temperature measurement 
* Optional theft and flooding alarm

## AQUALYS Software

****

AQUALYS is the software that manages the data transfer between the central PC and the WLM-Sensor, and enables a graphical and numerical display of these data. The user-friendly software provides the operator with information about the current leakage situation of the surveyed zone in the network. On an overall map the user verifies graphically if and where a leak appears. A more detailed screen of the leakage zone shows the numerical values and a time dependent diagram of FLOW, NOISE, PRESSURE and TEMPERATURE (optional).

Features:

* Easy setup
* Integrated web server 
* Short/ long term reports 
* Automatic offset adjustment of min/max levels 
* Compare measuring points just by one click 
* Automatic boundary setting 
* SMS-Warning 
* Remote setting of WLM-Sensor (i.e. measuring time) 
* Call each sensor immediately for actual data from the central PC or a notebook via modem, PCconnection or cable - or - the sensor is calling the PC or send SMS. 
* Automatic export option (connection to SCADA)
